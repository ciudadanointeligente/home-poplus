Billit is a piece of software that will allow you to keep your documents on-line as they should be: accesible. Once you model your document i.e. you say: it has a title, an identifier, a list of authors, an stage, a priority, etc. Billit will build a data base for them, will add a fully-functional API, will index the whole content of your documents (even the content of the referenced ones) allowing full text search.
Billit will soon be available with a user friendly GUI to manage all your documents, nowadays it is handled by API's methods, that's what any developer will need.

**Suggested uses:**

+ Bills tracking.
+ Patrimony declarations.
+ Memorandum archives.
+ Contracts monitoring.
