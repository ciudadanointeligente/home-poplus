SayIt is a web service which makes it easy to upload, store, structure, search and browse transcript data of speeches. By transcript data we mean data of the structure ‘Person X said thing Y’. 

It has been designed to make the business of publishing attractive, easily searchable speech transcripts as painless and quick as possible. We are also working on a range of tools for authoring speech data in the first place, which will write into SayIt via it’s REST API.

It is currently in pre-Alpha and will become public later in 2013.
