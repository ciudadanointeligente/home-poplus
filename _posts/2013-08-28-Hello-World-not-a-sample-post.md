This is a very humble post, actually it's almost done. The only reason to write this post is to tell the obvious, _this site is up_. 

Poplus.org was built to be the _hub_ for all who might be interested in **Poplus project** (to become a member, to use the technology, to ask for support, to point out a problem, to suggest a new feature or aliance). [MySociety][mysociety] and [Ciudadano Inteligente][fci] have been working for the last months in a set of components to support web application with civic purposes. Currently the list is short but it's enough to build a lot of websites, that's why we feel ready to say: "Hello World! Poplus project is ready to be use and grow".

In Poplus.org you'll find:

+ A description of Poplus project (what, why, who, etc)
+ Catalogue of components and their description.
+ Catalogue of deploys (using at least one poplus component) around the world.
+ Links to the workspace where poplus components are being developed (repositiries, mailing list, board of features and ideas).
+ A form to apply as volunteer.
+ A list of volunteers. 
+ This blog (anything related with poplus project we want to talk about).

We would like you to join the community in the level of your confort; there is no one way to be involved in poplus project, just find your way.


Techie P.S.: the website was built using [Jekyll][jekyll] and is hosted by [GitHub][github]. We totally love this new way of website creation.
