Pombola is mySociety's PMO platform. It allows you to do a number of things, such as store data on politicans, find your local representative, display hansard and in the future use [writeit][WriteIt] to write to your politicans. It creates a one-stop shop for information about parliamentarians allowing the electorate to see what their representatives are doing, and hold them to account.
