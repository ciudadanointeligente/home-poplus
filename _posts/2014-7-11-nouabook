###When you want one of your friends to answer a question, the chances are that you hop onto Facebook and leave them a message. What if you could do exactly the same with your MP?

June 23rd saw the soft launch of an innovative new tool that uses a [Poplus](http://poplus.org) Component as an integral part. It’s called [Nouabook.ma](http://nouabook.ma) and allows constituents in Morocco to contact their elected representatives, either through the website or while logged in to Facebook.

[Nouabook](http://nouabook.ma) is built on top of the [WriteIt](http://writeit.poplus.org) Poplus Component developed by [Ciudadano Inteligente](http://ciudadanointeligente.org) and connects into Facebook, one of the most used websites in Morocco. The group behind the site are [SimSim-Participation Citoyenne](http://simsim.ma) and developer Tarik Nesh-Nash.

This is an exciting time for the whole [Poplus](http://poplus.org) network. The community has been going from strength to strength since the conference in April, and this tool, the first built by an external group using a Poplus Component, is a real sign that it is beginning to spread its wings.

And of course, because all Poplus Components are open-source, [Nouabook](http://nouabook.ma) is available for any other group to use! An exciting prospect as social media is such an important tool for communication in today’s society.

###How did this project come about?

To decide the right approach, [SimSim](http://simsim.ma) and Tarik conducted surveys of citizens throughout Morocco to find out how many had ever contacted their representatives. The results showed that of 80 respondents, 81% had never written to their representative. Yet 73% said that if it was easier to get in touch, they would be more likely to contact their representative, on issues ranging from public transport to security at Moroccan universities.[[1]](http://nouabook.tumblr.com/)

Couple this thirst for communication with the fact that Facebook is one of the most popular websites in Morocco [[2]](http://www.wamda.com/2014/02/new-data-proves-facebook-s-extensive-reach-in-morocco), and the idea for Nouabook.ma was born.

[Nouabook](http://nouabook.ma) (meaning “Your Deputies” in Moroccan Arabic, but also a reference to the well known Facebook) allows users to find their representative, read a profile on them including their roles and responsibilities, and see their activity in Parliament. Most crucially, it also allows users to publicly put questions directly to their representatives, who can respond equally publicly on the site. A user can submit a question either by filling in a short form, or uploading a short video. Other users can vote on their questions, meaning the representative can quickly see which questions are most important for their constituents and prioritise their answers. For those who have authorised it, the question is posted automatically to their Facebook page. By enabling users to easily share questions and responses on their own timeline, this helps to spread information beyond the boundaries of the original Nouabook.ma site.

The site is currently in Beta and a small group of very engaged hand-picked representatives have signed up for the site. Of these, there are 4 or 5 who are already getting very involved answering questions, which is a huge success for the site. Once the pilot phase is over, the hope is to extend the platform to cover the whole Moroccan Parliament, so keep your eyes peeled for news come the next Parliamentary session in October.

So far the site is only in French, but if you read French and want to give some feedback there’s a short form [here](https://docs.google.com/a/mysociety.org/forms/d/1xDnaJb5SuYqUEbi2W5Zro7IAjGYUmEQn08p-f8XPgVA/viewform) which will help the team with their next stage of development. The site will soon be in Arabic as well.
