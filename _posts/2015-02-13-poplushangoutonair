# We are getting together online OnAir!

###Come and join us on the [Poplus live online Hangout](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/113916572031919197570/events/ckr16liandlncmstambmtmhjt1s) on Wednesday, February 18 2015!

If you're just visiting this site for the first time, here's a bit of background about Poplus.

Poplus is a global federation for the next generation of civic technology. 
We share knowledge and technology to help our organisations help citizens and we do this through collaborative civic coding. 
We share reusable open source civic technology components. We leverage open government data or make our own across many countries.

This online video-based event specially invites those new to Poplus, as we'll be talking about the idea behind Poplus and the founding of the community. But don't worry if you're not new! Everyone is welcome.

RSVP [here](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/113916572031919197570/events/ckr16liandlncmstambmtmhjt1s) to watch live (13:00 UTC) on Feb 18. The presentation includes Tom Steinberg from mySociety, Pablo Collada from FCI and Andres Snitcofski from Cargografias, among others from around the world on the Hangout-on-Air “stage.” Questions will be taken via comments on the Hangout event page. The video stream is one-way, commenting two-way.
