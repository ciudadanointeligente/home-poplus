# About
Poplus is a brand new federation - so new that its governance structure and mission are still being written.

What we do know is this: the world contains an ever-increasing number of people who are trying to use the internet to help citizens get what they want out of governments, politicians and other powerful people. As activists and technologists, we need better ways of sharing our knowledge, and our technology. Poplus, as a federation, is going to help us do this.

Recently about 80 people from all over the world met in Chile to discuss the basics of what we want Poplus to do - what we need it to do. And now, in May 2014, weâ€™re going to collaborate online to make Poplus into a real thing.

## Get involved
The first step was to put together a committee to run Poplus, and to put together a plan for our first year of existence. 

This committee has been formed of several sub-groups, which you can see [here](http://poplus.org/posts/santiago-conference-2014/).

If this sounds like something you want to be part of, please join our mailing list and [send a message](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) saying you want to be involved, and mentioning which sub-committee (or committees) you'd like to join.
