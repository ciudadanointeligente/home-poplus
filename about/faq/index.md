## New to Poplus? Read this first

Greetings, and welcome to Poplus. Thanks for visiting!

If you’re wondering just where to start, or how to get involved, you’re in the right place.

## What should I do first?

Here are three things that will start you off.

1. Find out what Poplus is: visit our [About page](http://poplus.org/about/) and read our FAQs below.
2. Understand what Poplus Components are: [see some Poplus Components in action](http://poplus.org/components/examples/).
3. Join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) and introduce yourself. Poplus is open to anyone who is interested, and the Google Group is where most activity and discussion takes place. You are welcome, whether you are from an organisation which might like to use a Poplus Component, or a developer who might like to help make them.


## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Poplus?

Poplus is an international federation for Collaborative Civic Coding. It is free to join.

Poplus brings together people who create civic software, and the organisations or people that use that software.

Its primary aim is to save time, energy and money for everyone, by supplying technical components that make it quicker and easier to build and maintain civic apps and websites. You can read more on our [About page](http://poplus.org/about/).

### How do I join Poplus?

There is no membership process; you become an active member by participating.

Join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus), say hello, and you’re in!

### What will Poplus do for me?

Poplus exists to help you save time, energy and money when it comes to building civic apps or websites.

Specifically it will do this by removing the need to program parts of your civic applications - it takes away the need to solve certain problems, such as mapping locations to political boundaries.

And it does it in a way that means you don’t have to buy into one programming language or operating system.

If you’re not sure if Poplus can help you, just join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) and tell us about the problem you’re trying to solve. We welcome techies, campaigners, everyone.

### What are the expectations in working with Poplus?

There is no minimum requirement. Every little helps.

### How do I make contact?

As there is no-one ‘in charge’ of Poplus, most communication is via the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus). This is the place to introduce yourself, ask questions, offer help and feedback, etc etc.

If you have a message that is better suited to one-on-one communication, you should mail hello [at] poplus.org. This email address is accessed by a number of active Poplus members, and one of them will respond.

### Still got questions?

Post them to the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus)!
