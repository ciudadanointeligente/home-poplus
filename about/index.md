Poplus is an open, free-to-join federation of people and organisations from many different countries, working in the civic technology arena. Our joint mission is to share knowledge and technology, so that our civic tech tools can be more useful to citizens.

Our central observation is this: civic websites and apps often contain some of the same features and functions, even when they’re being deployed in very different countries and for very different purposes. For example, it’s very common for civic websites to contain lists of public figures - politicians or business people.

At Poplus we believe that we can all save time and money when we share code that allows us to add these features more quickly and easily than if we build them from scratch. And we believe there is a way of doing this that doesn’t require everyone to adopt one huge shared language or framework.

Our answer is an approach called [Poplus Components](/components/). These are bits of code that solve single problems, and that can be accessed as web services. They don’t require you to use one specific programming language or operating system. They’re there to save time, not impose a new task on you.

## How did Poplus begin?

Poplus was originally conceived by two organisations - [Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente](http://ciudadanointeligente.org/) in Chile, and [mySociety](http://mysociety.org) in the UK. They realised that, despite their geographic distance from one another, they could work more efficiently when they shared their technologies.

In April 2014, the first Poplus conference invited people from civic organisations all over the world to come together, to shape and become part of this new movement. This conference generated great energy and has seen people starting to embrace the idea of Poplus, and the technologies, across large parts of the world.


## Where is Poplus going next?

Our current aims are:

- to bring the first generation of Poplus Components to maturity.
- to reach out to groups and individuals anywhere in the world who will benefit from using Poplus Components, and work with them to help them deploy these new technologies.
- to encourage debate and discussion from anyone within the civic or democratic tech areas, on our [online Poplus group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus)
- to discover what people want from [existing](/components/current/) and [new Components](/components/apply/)

If you’d like to get involved, you’re more than welcome. Come and say hello on the [online Poplus group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus).
