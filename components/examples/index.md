To understand the benefits of using a Poplus Component, it helps to see them in action.

Here are a few of the ways in which Poplus Components are being used on sites around the world.

## SayIt

<a href="http://sayit.mysociety.org/">Sayit</a> is software for making transcripts really easy to browse,  share, search and link to.

You can use SayIt for publishing what people said in meetings, trials, speeches - anything that involves people and the words they spoke.

Here are a couple of examples:

<div class="grid-row"><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://philadelphia.sayit.mysociety.org/speakers">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/example-sayit-philly.png">
  </a>

  <p><a href="http://philadelphia.sayit.mysociety.org/">Philadelphia City Council meetings</a> from January 2013 to March 2014 are presented here, so that Philadelphia 's residents can search for topics that particularly interest them, or simply browse by date or speaker to understand more about their council's internal workings.</p>

</div><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://www.pa.org.za/hansard/2014/february/20/proceedings-of-the-national-assembly-thursday-20-f/announcements-tablings-and-committee-reports-reply">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/example-sayit-pa.png">
  </a>

  <p>People's Assembly in South Africa use SayIt to <a href="http://www.pa.org.za/hansard/">publish the South African parliament's written record</a>.</p>

</div></div>

## PopIt

<a href="http://popit.poplus.org/">PopIt</a> is an easy way to store and publish lists of people and their positions - if you run a parliamentary monitoring website, you might use it for past and present members of Parliament and their job titles.

PopIt doesn't have to be for politicians, though: you can use it for any inter-related group of people.

Here are some websites where you can see it in use:

<div class="grid-row"><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://votainteligente.cl">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/example-popit-vota.png">
  </a>

  <p><a href="http://votainteligente.cl/">Vota Inteligente</a>, Chile, invited its users to 'vote for proposals, not slogans'  during the run-up to the 2013 presidential election.</p>

  <p>The site uses PopIt to present data on candidates and allow people to compare their track record and beliefs.</p>

</div><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://monitor.congresointeractivo.org/congresistas">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/example-popit-congreso.png">
  </a>

  <p><a href="http://monitor.congresointeractivo.org/">Congreso Interactivo</a> in Argentina is a classic parliamentary monitoring website, presenting votes and activity from members of the nation's congress.</p>

</div></div>

## MapIt

If you need your website to match governing bodies and geographic points, <a href="http://mapit.poplus.org/">MapIt</a> can help.

For example, ask your users to type in their zip code, and MapIt matches it to every constituency that covers that point. Once you know that, you match your user to the people who represent them in their local council, national government, and so on.

MapIt is useful for 'write to your politician' or 'find out who your politician is' websites, and 'report a problem with your street' sites, too.

See MapIt in action here:

<div class="grid-row"><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="https://www.writetothem.com">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/example-mapit-wtt.jpg">
  </a>

  <p>The UK site <a href="https://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a> asks users to input their postcode. It then displays all the people who represent them, from local councillors to members of parliament, and lets them write to them.</p>

  <p>Behind the scenes, it is MapIt which is matching the user's postcode to their representatives.</p>

</div><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://aduanku.my">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/example-mapit-aduanku.png">
  </a>

  <p><a href="http://aduanku.my/">Aduanku</a> is a Malaysian install of the FixMyStreet platform, which allows citizens to report problems with their local area, like potholes or broken streetlights.</p>

  <p>When users pinpoint the problem on a map, MapIt matches it to an area, so the site knows which council or official body is responsible for the repairs. It then sends the report off to them.</p>
