To understand the benefits of using a Poplus Component, it helps to see them in action.

Here are a few of the ways in which Poplus Components are being used on sites around the world.

* [SayIt](#sayit)
* [PopIt](#popit)
* [MapIt](#mapit)
* [Represent Boundaries](#represent-boundaries)
* [Cuttlefish](#cuttlefish)

Additionally, this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mysociety.org/spreadsheets/d/1O8-2uwUufcigjwxymcDaSJ25GpXfh1is63PUnhFgmhw/edit#gid=0">shared spreadsheet</a> lists every deployment of a Poplus Component we know about. Feel free to add anything we've missed.

<h2 id="sayit">SayIt</h2>

<a href="http://sayit.mysociety.org/">Sayit</a> is software for making transcripts really easy to browse,  share, search and link to.

You can use SayIt for publishing what people said in meetings, trials, speeches - anything that involves people and the words they spoke.

Here are a couple of examples:

<div class="grid-row"><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://philadelphia.sayit.mysociety.org/speakers">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/example-sayit-philly.png">
  </a>

  <p><a href="http://philadelphia.sayit.mysociety.org/">Philadelphia City Council meetings</a> from January 2013 to March 2014 are presented here, so that Philadelphia 's residents can search for topics that particularly interest them, or simply browse by date or speaker to understand more about their council's internal workings.</p>

</div><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://www.pa.org.za/hansard/2014/february/20/proceedings-of-the-national-assembly-thursday-20-f/announcements-tablings-and-committee-reports-reply">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/example-sayit-pa.png">
  </a>

  <p>People's Assembly in South Africa use SayIt to <a href="http://www.pa.org.za/hansard/">publish the South African parliament's written record</a>.</p>

<h2 id="popit">PopIt</h2>

<a href="http://popit.poplus.org/">PopIt</a> is no longer in active development. 

Here are some websites where you can see it when it was in use:

<div class="grid-row"><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://votainteligente.cl">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/example-popit-vota.png">
  </a>

  <p><a href="http://votainteligente.cl/">Vota Inteligente</a>, Chile, invited its users to 'vote for proposals, not slogans'  during the run-up to the 2013 presidential election.</p>

  <p>The site uses PopIt to present data on candidates and allow people to compare their track record and beliefs.</p>

</div><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://monitor.congresointeractivo.org/congresistas">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/example-popit-congreso.png">
  </a>

  <p><a href="http://monitor.congresointeractivo.org/">Congreso Interactivo</a> in Argentina is a classic parliamentary monitoring website, presenting votes and activity from members of the nation's congress.</p>

</div></div>

<h2 id="mapit">MapIt</h2>

If you need your website to match governing bodies and geographic points, <a href="http://mapit.poplus.org/">MapIt</a> can help.

For example, ask your users to type in their zip code, and MapIt matches it to every constituency that covers that point. Once you know that, you match your user to the people who represent them in their local council, national government, and so on.

MapIt is useful for 'write to your politician' or 'find out who your politician is' websites, and 'report a problem with your street' sites, too.

See MapIt in action here:

<div class="grid-row"><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="https://www.writetothem.com">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/example-mapit-wtt.jpg">
  </a>

  <p>The UK site <a href="https://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a> asks users to input their postcode. It then displays all the people who represent them, from local councillors to members of parliament, and lets them write to them.</p>

  <p>Behind the scenes, it is MapIt which is matching the user's postcode to their representatives.</p>

</div><div class="column-one-of-two">

  <a href="http://aduanku.my">
    <img class="example-screenshot" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/example-mapit-aduanku.png">
  </a>

  <p><a href="http://aduanku.my/">Aduanku</a> is a Malaysian install of the FixMyStreet platform, which allows citizens to report problems with their local area, like potholes or broken streetlights.</p>

  <p>When users pinpoint the problem on a map, MapIt matches it to an area, so the site knows which council or official body is responsible for the repairs. It then sends the report off to them.</p>

</div></div>

<h2 id="represent-boundaries">Represent Boundaries</h2>

[Represent Boundaries](http://represent.poplus.org/) helps to provide relevant information based on your user's location. For example, collect a user's address on your website, use Represent Boundaries to find the geographic area that covers their location, and then display relevant content, like inviting supporters to take local actions or running “email your elected official” campaigns.

You can also use Represent Boundaries to organize your people database by geographic area. After matching people to geographic areas using Represent Boundaries, you can segment people geographically, to match your volunteers, donors or voters to electoral districts to better mobilize volunteers, organize donation drives or target canvassing.

Represent Boundaries is used by some of the most popular civic and democratic websites:

<h2 id="cuttlefish">Cuttlefish</h2>

[Cuttlefish](https://cuttlefish.oaf.org.au) is a transactional email server. It ensures your mails get to their destination without fuss, handling bounces, and optionally tracking email opens and link clicks so you can better understand how people are using your emails.

At the [OpenAustralia Foundation](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/) we've been using Cuttlefish for almost 2 years to reliably send lots of emails from a number of our projects including:
