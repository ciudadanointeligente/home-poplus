Who builds Components? Anybody who wants to, and has the skills to create an open source piece of code that can be used by civic activists around the world. If that’s you, read on.

## If you already have some code, or an idea

Come and talk on the [online Poplus Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus): discover whether there’s a need for your Component, and if anything similar has already been built. Tap into the experience of our worldwide network of developers, and find out if there are any features or requirements you may not have thought of.

Once your Component is ready, you can have it [certified](#certified).

## If you have no ideas, but plenty of enthusiasm
Like to build a Component, but don’t yet have an idea for one? Then:

1. Make sure you know [what a Component is](/components/definition)
2. Start a discussion in the [online Poplus Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus), where you can talk to the kinds of groups and people who will be using your software, and find out what they really need.
3. Take a look at the [Poplus Trello board](https://trello.com/b/5gGF4xrJ/ideas-for-new-poplus-components), where suggestions for new Components are made.

## How to get your software certified as a Poplus Component
Anyone can apply to have a piece of software certified as an official Poplus Component. Once certified it can be given a section on Poplus.org and will be discussed, used and celebrated by Poplus members around the world.

## Why apply to have your code certified as a Poplus Component?
If your code becomes a Poplus Component, we’ll promote it on the website and at the events we attend.

Poplus Components make it easier for people to build civic and democratic and campaigning websites and apps of all kinds. Your software will help activists, journalists and regular citizens all over the world, not just now but in the years ahead.

## How to apply
Make a copy of this [application form](https://docs.google.com/a/mysociety.org/document/d/1N70pkeuUc4npp-QerZo68YjvnULNRgakmYv8OCOFsKo/edit), fill it in, and send it to the [Poplus Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) to let us know that you’ve applied. We’ll get back to you within a week with feedback.

## An important note
Your software may not immediately fulfill all the criteria necessary to be labelled a Component. We encourage people to see applying as a learning process - it’s possible (even likely) that your code will need to be refined or modified before it gets the official ‘Poplus Component’ certification.

## Who manages the certification process?
The certification process is undertaken by a small group of Poplus members who have volunteered to oversee submissions.

If you have any questions or want to learn more about Poplus, Components, or this process, please join the [Poplus Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus).
