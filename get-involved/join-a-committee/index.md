title: Join a committee
---

We have divided the current workload between a number of committees. These groups meet online (via Skype, Google Hangouts or other convenient technologies) at regular intervals, to discuss and divide up the work that needs to be done.

Committee membership is open to anyone, anywhere in the world. Just check our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/poplus) to find out when the next meeting of you chosen committee will be, and come along.

If you can't make it, don't worry - the agenda will be on a shared document that is open for your comments.

## Current committees

Looking for all committee documents? Here's [easy access to all agendas, minutes and other resources](http://hackfoldr.org/poplusteam/).

### Components committee

The Components group will offer support in the creation and use of Poplus Components, and will also work towards the creation of a certification standard.
Their duties will include overseeing / helping with scoping and technical documentation of Poplus Components, as well as giving technical support to anyone who needs it. **[Notes from recent Components meetings are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zq3lkLI05rZmO0hC5RZVErPts5065x4Gj5N_otn2As/view?pli=1&overridemobile=true#heading=h.qlwmoenuh7f3)**.

### Events committee

This group will be working together to run Poplus meet-ups, conferences and talks, and also to make sure that we are represented at existing events.
We particularly welcome people from any country who are happy to go and talk about Poplus at conferences or meet-ups. **[Notes from recent Events meetings are here](https://popluscon.hackpad.com/Events-Group-1st-Meeting-Agenda-and-Notes-BnLhF57G61Q)**.

### Communications committee

The Communications group will be setting a strategy for outreach to potential members and member organisations. They'll also look after our website and social media, and there's a plan to make sure that members share their stories and experiences for the benefit of everyone.
If you have translation skills, this group want to hear from you, too! **[Notes from recent Communications meetings are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H4Qu7t0bJmbVOq3C9mQoxAmTNoTenAGkprhrZSIEmxI/edit#)**

### Governance committee

Poplus won’t succeed if it doesn’t have a plan, and enthusiastic people who want to see that plan become reality.
That’s what the governance committee is for - it’s a group of people from different countries and organisations who are working together to make Poplus really work. Right now, they are working on an action plan for the next twelve months.

### Finance committee

Every organisation has its financial issues, and Poplus is no different.
The Finance group will be looking at issues such as obtaining funding grants, which jurisdiction we should be registered in, and how best to oversee our funds. **[Notes from recent Finance meetings are here](https://popluscon.hackpad.com/Finance-Committee-Call-Agenda-tvW3dW5BJY3#:h=3%29-What-should-the-Federation-)**
