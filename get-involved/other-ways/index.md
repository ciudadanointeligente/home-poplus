So you’ve joined the [Poplus Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus)? Great! That’s where all our discussions happen. Now here are some other valuable ways to get involved.

Poplus aims to bring together the creators of civic technology, and the groups and people who need to use them. So - if you’re a coder, see below. If you’re an end user, [click here](#activist).

## If you're a coder

### 1. Join the Google Group

Join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus)and ask if anyone needs any help using existing Poplus Components. You might be able to lend a hand to someone with an important project!

### 2. Find out about Poplus Components

First, make sure you understand what [Poplus Components](/components/) are - you’ll need this knowledge before you progress to the following points.

### 3. Help us try Components out

Software always needs testers, and your feedback will be invaluable. Visit  the [Poplus online group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) to find out if there are any Components that are at the testing stage. Or view [existing Components](/components/current/) and give them a go - feedback is extremely welcome for these, too.

### 4. Help assess software for inclusion as a Poplus Component
Poplus Components aspire to meet [specific requirements](/components/definition/). We welcome coders who can help us assess new submissions to see whether or not they meet these guidelines - holler in the [Poplus online group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) and we’ll let you know when we need you.

### 5. Develop new Poplus Components, or find out if your software already qualifies to be one

Perhaps you’d like to write a new Component - or maybe you’ve already written some Open Source software that you’d like to share with the community. Let us know in the [Poplus online group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) and we’ll point you towards the submission process.

### 6. Help others who want to use Poplus Components

Poplus Components are for anyone who needs them - whatever their level of technical expertise. As a result, technical queries will arise, and we can always use coders and developers who can respond.

### 7. Join in discussions

We always need coders’ input on questions that arise in the [Poplus online group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus), from what direction Poplus should be taking, to which features might be most needed in a new Component. Don’t be shy - we’d love to hear your opinions.

### 8. Tell your friends and acquaintances

If you move in the civic tech world, at work or in your social life, do us a favour and make sure your associates know about Poplus.

### Tell us about yourself

Coders in the Poplus community need to hear from people who are trying to use digital technologies to empower citizens, open governments and get things changed. They want to know about your needs, your frustrations and what does and doesn’t work.

You can help Poplus by sharing your experiences. Please post them to the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus).

### See if any of the Poplus Components can help you

Poplus Components are nifty pieces of code that help civic groups with common digital tasks, like storing names of politicians, or publishing everything they say.

You can see some examples of [how Components are being used on this page](/components/examples/), and find out [what’s currently available here](/components/current/).

Interested in using a Component? Or maybe you don’t see quite what you need? Join the [Poplus online group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) and tell us all about it.

## Whatever you are
