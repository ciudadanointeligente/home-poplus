      <p>Poplus was a global network of organisations working in Civic Tech. Its aim was that members would make and share code which could empower citizens anywhere in the world.</p>

        <p>In 2014, the UK organisation <a href="https://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a> and the Chilean <a href="https://ciudadanointeligente.org/">Fundación Ciudadano Intelligente</a> conceived of Poplus, a global federation for Civic Tech. Members came together in a landmark conference in Santiago, and pledged to create code components that would be free and simple to use, for people anywhere in the world.</p>

        <p>These components would help activists and organisations when building online tools that empower citizens. They’d take the hard work out of creating systems to track or contact politicians; to represent constituency boundaries, or to create transcripts of public meetings, to reference but a few of the components that went on to be created under the Poplus banner.</p>

        <p>The concept behind Poplus has evolved.</p>

        <p>Poplus was founded on the belief that wasted effort was going into the building of Civic Tech tools that were, essentially, being coded from scratch, in different countries, time and again. We wanted to prevent people from having to reinvent the wheel, so that they could get on with the important business of running their own sites.</p>

        <p>While we still stand by this principle, we found that in reality, creating components to fit any and every type of legislature was more of a challenge than we’d anticipated. And we discovered another way that we could provide help to those organisations, activists and campaigners: by providing reliable political data.</p>

        <p>mySociety is now contributing to the <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/democracy/democratic-commons/">Democratic Commons</a>, largely through the <a href="https://everypolitician.org/">EveryPolitician project</a>, which in turn is aiding the global repository of politician data on <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>.</p>

        <p>By providing a reliable source of accurate data, we can remove one of the key challenges for  Civic Tech projects. <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">Find out more about mySociety’s projects here.</a></p>
